# Personal Portfolio Page

## Description
This wepage displays samples of my prominent applications with navigation links to my contact details and information about me. It was developed without an existing codebase to showcase interactive image links and an adaptive user display.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The website contains navigation links that seamlessly scroll to their respective headers and allows viewers to use links presented as images to other websites. 

Navigation Links:
![alt text](assets/images/screen?raw=true)
![alt text](assets/images/screen-2?raw=true)

Image Links: clicking on an image sends you to a website. Look for alt attributes for detailed descriptions.
![alt text](assets/images/screen-3?raw=true)
![alt text](assets/images/screen-4?raw=true)

The display elements are able to adapt to mobile devices as the sections and elements wrap around the screen for increased visibility. To see this in action, you'll need to right-click on the website and press "Inspect", then use the DevTools (if you are using Chrome) to see this in action.

1) Right-click and press "Inspect":

2) Find the mobile icon which should be on the top left of the console (Google Chrome DevTool):
![alt text](assets/images/screen-6?raw=true)

3) Look for the side bar on the left (with the 2 vertical lines) and click and drag left and right to see the page's flexboxes shrink and grow!
